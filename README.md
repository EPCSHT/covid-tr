Latest data are available at this URL: https://api.apify.com/v2/key-value-stores/28ljlt47S5XEd1qIi/records/LATEST?disableRedirect=true

You can find a dataset with unique history items here https://api.apify.com/v2/datasets/LYeOfHQwsv7FsfdGV/items?format=json&clean=1

Note: Government of Health in Turkey presents the data as image and the actor uses Google Vision to scrape it. That's why the actor needs an API key and there is no example run on the page.
